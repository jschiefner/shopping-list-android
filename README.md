## Shopping List Android App

This app allows me to keep tracks of my shopping list. Items are split in categories which allow me to display items by section in the order i would pass them in a supermarket so i dont have to run around finding stuff from the list i missed earlier on. Items are sorted in categories automatically, assuming there has been a one-time assignment made for that item.

#### Get it up and running

This app uses the Google Cloud Firstore Database to keep in sync with all participating devices. In order to use it you have to create a firebase project at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). Once you created a project you can download the `google-services.json` file. After cloning the repository this file has to be put in the `/app` directory. After this, you can run the project in Android Studio!
